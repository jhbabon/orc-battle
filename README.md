The Orc Battle Game
===================

From The Land of Lisp book.

How to play
-----------

You need the `clisp` interpreter.

In the command line, call the interpreter with the game:

```console
$ cd /path/to/the/game/orc-battle
$ clisp -i game.lisp
```

Inside `clisp`, init the game:

```lisp
(orc-battle)
```
